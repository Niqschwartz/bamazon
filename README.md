# bamazon

This is the Bamazon app. It is a node application that allows users to look at an inventory list from a database. The user is then prompted to select which item they would like to buy, and how many units of that item. If there are not enough items in stock, it will give the user a message telling them so. If there are enough items in stock, it will deduct that amount from the current stock quantity, and then display a new updates inventory list.

I've added a quick video tutorial of the application in use below:
